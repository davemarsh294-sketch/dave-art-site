It was taken on the evening of a Strawberry Moon which had just risen over the hills and had produced an eerie light. The navigation lights on the television mast which was situated in the hills added to the haunting atmosphere.....and then some man with a dog on his head and a puppy on his lap came cycling into the scene!"

I thought the image of Templehof would make a good background for the drawing of Sushil."
